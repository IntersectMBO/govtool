## 🔑 Generate API Keys

### Blockfrost API Key

- To generate a Blockfrost API key (Project ID):

  1. Follow the instructions in the [Blockfrost documentation](https://blockfrost.dev/overview/getting-started) 📚.
  2. The **Project ID** you create there serves as your **Blockfrost API Key**.
  3. Copy the **Project ID** and set it as `BLOCKFROST_API_KEY`.

  🔐 Note: Ensure you select the correct network for the **Project ID** that matches the host URL from the environment listed above.

### Kuber API Key

- To generate a Kuber API Key:
  1. Visit [Kuberide](https://kuberide.com/) 🌐.
  2. Log in using your Google or GitHub account.
  3. Navigate to **API Keys** ⚙️.

## 🔧 Faucet wallet Configuration

This section guides you through generating a Cardano faucet wallet and configuring it for use. Follow the steps below to create and set the config on env

### Step 1: Generate a Faucet Wallet

Run the following command to generate a new faucet wallet:

```bash
npm run generate-faucet-wallet
```

The script will:

- Display the wallet details (payment private key, stake public key hash, and wallet address) in the terminal.

**Example Output:**

```
🎉 Wallet generated successfully!
-----------------------------------
🔑 Payment Private Key: <your-payment-private-key>
💰 Stake Private Key: <your-stake-private>
🏠 Wallet Address: <your-wallet-address>
-----------------------------------

📋 Please copy the following to your environment variables:
1. Set FAUCET_PAYMENT_PRIVATE=<your-payment-private-key>
2. Set FAUCET_STAKE_PRIVATE=<your-stake-private>
3. Set FAUCET_ADDRESS=<your-wallet-address>

🎈 All set! Please ensure this wallet is funded with a sufficient balance
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Securely store the generated wallet details in your environment variables. Add the following to your `.env` file or environment configuration:

```env
FAUCET_PAYMENT_PRIVATE=<your-payment-private-key>
FAUCET_STAKE_PKH=<your-stake-pkh>
FAUCET_ADDRESS=<your-wallet-address>
```

⚠️ **Security Note**: Store your wallet details in a secure location for future use. The payment private key is sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to your funds.

### Step 3: Fund the Wallet

Ensure your wallet has enough funds for your test runs. The required balance depends on the specific tests you plan to execute (see test-specific details below).

To fund your wallet on the **Preview** or **Preprod** network:

1. Use the Cardano Testnet Faucet:  
   [https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet) 🌐  
   **Note**: There is a daily limit of **10,000 ADA** per wallet.

2. If the funded amount is insufficient, transfer additional ADA from another wallet. 💸

To check your wallet balance:

Visit:

```
https://${network}.cardanoscan.io/address/<your-wallet-address>
```

- Replace `${network}` with the appropriate network (e.g., `preprod` or `preview`).
- Replace `<your-wallet-address>` with your wallet address. 🔍

**Example**:

- For a preview wallet: `https://preview.cardanoscan.io/address/<your-wallet-address>`
- Monitor the balance to ensure it meets the requirements for individual or all test runs.
