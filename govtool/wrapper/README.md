Recommended [`React developer tools`](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).

To automatically set correct node version:

1. Install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Install `lts/hydrogen` version of node

```bash
  nvm install lts/hydrogen
```

3. Having that every time you enter the `govtool/frontend` package [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) automatically sets the correct version of node.

## To Develop

### Standard way

```

#### Using Nix and Direnv

1. Get [Nix](https://nixos.org/download).
