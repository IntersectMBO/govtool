// utils.js
// This file is designed to house small, reusable utility functions that serve as building blocks for constructing more complex functionalities within the application.
// It includes a range of generic helpers for tasks like data manipulation, formatting, and validation.
// Additionally, this file may contain functions for testing purposes, providing a toolkit for verifying the correctness and efficiency of larger functions.
// By centralizing these utilities, we promote a modular and maintainable codebase, facilitating ease of development and testing.
